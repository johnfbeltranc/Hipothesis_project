    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique used to compare the measures of two or more groups. The idea behind ANOVA is to decompose the total variability in the data into two components: between-group variability and within-group variability:\n",

    "- Null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) he means of all groups are equal.\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis ($H_{1}$) at least one group mean is different.\n",
    "If the ANOVA test result is significant (e.g., a p-value less than a threshold such as 0.05), this suggests that at least one group mean is different.\n"
